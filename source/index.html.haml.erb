      My past work has been varied—Fortune 500’s, agencies, and freelancing; but I’ve found I espcecially love working with energetic, early-stage startups. I bring experience in many ancillory startup activities, including:  managing remote teams, organizing release cycles, mediating founder squabbles, project management, sniffing out bullshit, hiring, and turning business priorities into actionable and meaningful direction.
