PSDTUTS+ posted <a href="http://psd.tutsplus.com/tutorials/interface-tutorials/how-to-elevate-your-website-design-process-and-results/" rel="nofollow">How to Elevate Your Website Design Process and Results</a>, a <strong>web interface tutorial</strong> that I wrote for them about web interface design. This web interface tutorial focuses on creating a business web interface design with a fun side; some of the ideas and patterns explained include the 960 grid system, consistency within your designs, the hierarchy of elements, Photoshop keywords and websafe fonts.

For example, consistency is a reoccurring theme through out the web interface tutorial. From small things (such as making sure the radius of corners is always the same) to more obvious concerns (like that all buttons are set in the same type), consistency is a practice I heavily emphasize. If the readers of the tutorial can understand the importance of consistency and how useful it is in aiding the scanability and usability of a website, they will walk away with a more enlightened view of web interface design.

PSDTUTs approached me to write this web interface tutorial because they admired my work and felt I could help other web designers achieve the same level of success in their designs. Since it was my first web interface tutorial, I was quite overwhelmed with the difficulty of not only gathering the images, but actually writing the tutorial itself. While at times I venture off topic here and there, I feel the final product was a great in-depth look at the web design process, best practices, patterns and tricks.
