		I'm currently working for an awesome startup in the online dating market, and part of the logo exploration I created this heart stone. Ultimately, The choice was to go with one of the other icons I had designed, but I really liked this as a stand along icon and it had a warm reception on <a href="http://dribbble.com/chapolito">my Dribbble</a> (my most liked shot) so I thought it would be a good PSD to share. The actual heart stone is a vector smart object, so yo can tweak it to your heart's content. Hope you enjoy!
