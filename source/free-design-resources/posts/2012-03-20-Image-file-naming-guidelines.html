	<p>
	Naming your image files clearly and consistently can make a developer's life a lot easier, so I wrote out a few of the guidelines I follow when naming my image files:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Use dashes between words instead of underscores, mostly for SEO reasons, as dashes are read as spaces and underscores are not.</li>
	<br />
		<li>All button image names start with "button-" this will group all your buttons together in an alphabetized list.</li>
	<br />
		<li>Hover state image names end with "-hover" ending instead of starting with hover insures that the hover and normal states are still grouped together in an alphabetized list.</li>
	<br />
		<li>Active state image names end with "-active" same grouping technique as with hover.</li>
	<br />
		<li>All form image names start with "input-" same grouping technique as with buttons.</li>
	<br />
		<li>All background images names end with "-bg"same grouping technique as with hover and active.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	I'm sure there are a ton more conventions for naming image files and I invite you to <a href="mailto:hello@chapolito.com">send me your suggestions</a>!
