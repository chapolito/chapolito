	I am happy to announce that Chapolito has won a 2011 Webby Award! Collaborating with [Highly Evolved](http://highlyevolved.com/)'s incredible Cosmo Jones and the ever talented [Kimi Lewis](http://kimilewis.com/), we envisioned and designed [A Thin Line](http://www.athinline.org/) for MTV. The site won a Webby Award for the Best Youth Website.

	The focus of A Thin Line was to engage with teenagers and young adults and demonstrate the dangers of digital abuse. The first phase of the project involved an interactive video quiz where visitors were questioned on their responses to various types of digital abuse. At the end of the quiz visitors are shown their total score and given resources depending on what sections they had trouble with in the quiz. The remainder of the site is dedicated to housing educational resources for teens.

	It was an awesome project and we are all super excited &amp; honored by the award!
