  I've been seeing so many awesome examples of music and **synth app designs<** around, I had to try it out! I know this is very trendy, but I was really impressed with the lighting that designers like Jonas Eriksson were utilizing. It was both the lighting and perespective of the entire app design, but also the recreation of LED lights that I really thought was fantastic. And I was struggling to reproduce these details myself, so while I don't have any plans to make a synth app, I spent a lot of hours just messing around with this PSD file and tinkering with different effects to get a desired final product. I think I've learned a fair bit through this project, and since it was just for fun I thought I'd share it with you! :)

  I'm currently working on an app design that while isn't very similar in aesthetic to this design, employs a lot of the little tricks and lighting tips I learned while making this free PSD. In the PSD file there is the play button for the synth, and on/off indicator light and a cabinet with 3 speakers.
