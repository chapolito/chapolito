        %p.intro At Life360 I’ve had the opportunity to lead design on numerous projects, but the most challenging was revamping the messaging system. This meant both a visual UI overhaul and a fresh UX approach to integrating messaging into the location and coordination layers of Life360. In addition to messaging I worked closely with the premium team to boost revenue, proposed features like the weather overlays, and contributed to our component library and design system.

        %h3.animated Weather Overlays
        %p.animated After the launch of battery level we heard from our users that the simple act of sharing and knowing was making families feel closer. So I started thinking—what else can we let users passively share? Weather provided actionable information in the local vicinity, but also a spark for conversation or thought with family that lives far away.
