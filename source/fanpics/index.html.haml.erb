        %p.intro Anyone that has ever attended a sporting event knows the rush of adrenaline when their team scores a goal, sinks the winning basket or hits a walk-off homerun. These moments are at the core of sports, and are memories that can last a lifetime.

      %h3 Learning Android
      %p On of the greatest opportunities I’ve had at Fanpics is learning to design for Android. We originally launched Fanpics as a hybrid app for our prototype season at SDSU, which was great for getting to market so quickly. But as soon as that season wrapped up we knew it was time to take what we’d learned and go native. I’d never before designed for Android, so it was an exciting and challenging experience.
      %p Luckily the launch of Android coincided with Google’s release of Material Design, so I was able to immerse myself in their extensive docs. Along with listening a lot to our Android Developer’s wealth of knowledge I quickly got up to speed.
