		In the party vector pack you will find a number of bottle vector graphics, including a wine bottle vector, beer bottle vector and numerous party themed vectors that are associated with bottles such as champagne cork vector, martini olive vector, red beer cup vector, and a lime slice vector.

		For the smokers, there are a cigar vector and cigarette vector, although I must admit I find both of these repulsive! Regardless, cigars are often a celebratory indulgence to many people in a party and celebrating mood.
</p><p>
		For those culturally inclined, I have included my favorite: a donkey piñata vector. He’s so colorful and fun! I never had a party as a child without a piñata — in fact, I still don’t , and it's always the highlight of the party. Of course that is also why I have included the cake vector - because no party is complete without a birthday cake. Celebrate a birthday with a birthday cake vector and do it with style!
</p><p>

		When it comes to giant celebrations (such as an independence day), you can now celebrate with a real ‘BANG!’ with a fireworks vector. The illustration of the fireworks vector is sure to excite your friends and guests.
</p><p>
		Additionally there is a Mardi Gras mask vector, beer keg vector, top hat vector, cool shades vector, and illegal pills vectors (for those of you who like to push your luck). I hope you can make good use of these vectors!
