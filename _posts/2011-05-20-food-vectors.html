	If you're looking for some <strong>free food vectors</strong> then you've come to the right place! I've used these vectors in a few projects for web design and graphic design and was so pleased with the results that I decided to share them with the world. These food vectors are completely free, the only stipulation I make is that if you distribute them then you must have a link back to this article. with that said you are, of course, encouraged to share these free vectors on your blog, website or twitter feed.
