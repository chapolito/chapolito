		The idea for this little illustration popped into my head while I was browsing dribbble, I think also I was influenced by Moonrise Kingdom, which I recently watched and enjoyed. The left feather is supposed to resemble a peacock, the middle more of an eagle and the right feather was a bit more freeform, but I'm  going to call it a parrot. The texture is just a simple watercolor image with some slight adjustments (desaturation, 40% opacity, and screen blending mode) Hope you enjoy!
