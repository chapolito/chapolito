  testimonial: 'Of the designers I’ve worked with, Jesse is the most approachable, receptive, knowledgable and talented. He’s also an extremely nice guy, always keen to promote healthy company culture.

  testimonial: 'Jesse has been a member of our core creative team and involved in dozens of graphic designs for MTV and VH1 related projects — specifically, digital/web designs and apparel design. Jesse is a creative force that is always innovative and unique, but also understands and works exceptionally well in an enterprise-level business environment that requires a rapid pace, the sometimes endless iterations to his creative material to reach our branding visions, and the patience and focus to deliver high quality projects every time and on time.'

  title: 'Creative &amp; Professional&hellip;'
  testimonial: 'Jesse is an extremely trustworthy and hard working individual. His work ethic and creativity sets him apart from the rest. For every deadline he was given, he turned in his work in a very timely manner. He needed little to no hand holding and was always thinking outside of the box. In addition, he was easily reachable and very responsive when we needed him. What I admire most about Jesse, though, is that his attitude makes it appear that he doesn’t do the work because he has to, but rather because he wants to. I would highly recommend Jesse to anyone looking for an amazing graphic designer.‎'

  title: 'Professionally outstanding!'
  testimonial: 'Jesse is a fantastic designer and highly recommended. I approached him out of the blue with a project and he was able to accommodate my design concerns and budget limitations. As this was my first time dealing with a designer, he went above and beyond the call of duty, helping me through the process every step of the way. Jesse consistently remained on top of emails and stayed in communication through a variety of means, which is of course very important when dealing with a designer online. His design was exactly what I was looking for and fit my financial limits as well. Cannot recommend him more highly. Do business with this guy!!'
